# Data visualization

This repository contains samples for my Data visualization projects and reports created using **Power BI**, **Tableau** and **Kibana**.

### Power BI 

In this project, were created dashboards related to Covid-19 pandemic that provide up-to-date data about coronavirus infections and deaths worldwide, using the Data Visualization tool **Power BI**. Data can be filtered by country or even by cases and deaths and the top 10 countries are also presented.
