# Data visualization

This repository contains samples for my Data visualization projects and reports created using **Power BI**, **Tableau** and **Kibana**.

### Power BI 

In this project, we created dashboards related to Covid-19 pandemic that provide up-to-date data about coronavirus
infections and deaths worldwide, using the Data Visualization tool **Power BI**. Data can be filtered by country,
or even by cases and deaths and also the top 10 countries are presented.  


### Tableau

Next, information around the TSA Claims Data, compiled by the Department of Homeland Security of the United States
are visualized. The datasets contain data about the years 2002-2014 and the dashboards we created, categorize claims
by year, claims by airport, claims status by year, items by claim amount, and items by airport. To perform this project
we used the Data Visualization tool **Tableau**.
